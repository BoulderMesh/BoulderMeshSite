Boulder Mesh uses [cjdns](https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns) as its underlying mesh networking technology. Detailed instructions for installing cjdns can be found [here](https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns#how-to-install-cjdns). Once installed, you must connect to an existing node in order to join the rest of the network. To find an peer, ask in our [IRC](/chat) channel or on our [mailing list](http://list.bouldermesh.net).
