Boulder Mesh is a group discussion and project to build technology for a decentralized and cryptographically safe network in Boulder. There are a number of concerns people have regarding the internet and Boulder Mesh is exploring what it means for each of us to have responsibility and authority over how we communicate our data.

The best way to start is to attend our [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Boulder-Meshnet/).
